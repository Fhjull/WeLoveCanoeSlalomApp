# WeLoveCanoeSlalom

App for canoe slalom sportsmen and couches

The idea is to develop two test forms, one for morning and one for evening,
that sportsman should fill every day. In calendar will be highlighted all
days when diary was filled, so that he can find all previously completed
tests. Also there will be several graphs to watch dynamics.
Couches will have access to all their sportsmen tests to monitor their fulfillment.
